                <p>I have learned a lot of things, especially when i discovered django and flask and with Django it was
                    a beautiful experience avoiding the 'php' and 'js' server side. Got also a small experience with a
                    university company which specialized with machine learning problems. But it was difficult for me
                    because of the level of the project (Senior project). Also, it was 60% build with JavaScript/JQuery,
                    for server side. My issues and tasks in this company was related to Js/Jquery and because of this
                    issue i was out. In this part i worked 1 year, i was in the same university i'm studying right
                    now(ITMO), i got a small experience with flask(this project contained a machine learning tasks with
                    GASPROM company), after that we started with a platform that used the Django framework.</p>
